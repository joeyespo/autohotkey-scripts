My AutoHotkey Scripts
---------------------

This is a compilation of my favorite AutoHotkey scripts.
Some of these have been downloaded and tweaked. Others were
written by me. Each individual ahk file indicates which.


Scripts Included
----------------

- Adjust volume with the mouse wheel, and mute/unmute with middle button click
- Alt+LButton to drag windows from anywhere, instead of by using the title bar
- Capslock key will open a new Google page; Shift+Capslock is the old capslock
- Ctrl+V will paste text from the clipboard when working within command prompt
- WindowsKey+N to run or activate Notepad; WindowsKey+H to toggle hidden files
